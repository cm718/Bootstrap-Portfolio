        <p>My name is Chris and I am a Christian, husband, father, and pastor. I also work full time for Apple. I am now adding developer to the list. I decided to start learning to code a few months back at the recommendation of a friend from work. He had just begun this program and suggested I check out some online courses to see what I thought of it.</p>
        <p>I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I really enjoyed the challenge and sense of success when things worked. As the months went by I found myself really loving the learning process. My wife and I began to discuss the possibility of a career change. I was learning more about web development as well as the wonderful job market that exists for developers.</p>
        <p>I decided that when the next boot camp opened up I would apply and here I am today. I look forward to refining what I already know as well as building on my current skills, specifically with Javascript and back end development.</p>
